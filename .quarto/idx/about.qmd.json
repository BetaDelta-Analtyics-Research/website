I am also a U.S. Marine Corps Veteran.  My family and I call Franklin, Tennessee home (just south of Nashville).  I enjoy scrutinizing soccer highlights, reading leadership literature, and leveling-up on data visualization techniques.  I dabble in military history, geography, and theology and also like to hike when I can find the time.  I currently work full-time for Ramsey Solutions as a data analyst in the digital marketing and real estate business analytics space.\n\n---\n\n### Professional Credentials\n\n###### Certificate in Investment Performance Measurement\n\nCFA Institute\n\n###### Certified Tableau Desktop Specialist\n\nTableau\n\n###### Certified Data Science Professional\n\nDataCamp\n\n---\n\n### Academic Credentials\n\n#### Master of Science\n\n|     Data Science (current candidate) | Eastern University\n|     Leadership | Norwich University\n|     Accounting & Financial Management | University of Maryland Global Campus\n\n#### Graduate Certificate\n\n|     Compuatational Finance | University of Washington\n\n#### Bachelor of Science\n\n|     International Business | Messiah University\n\n#### Associate of Arts\n\n|     Spanish | Defense Language Institute\n\n---\n\n### Professional Experience\n\n###### Ramsey Solutions\n\n|     Data Analyst II\n\n###### T.
