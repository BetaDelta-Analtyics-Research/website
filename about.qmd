## Brian Davidhizar, CIPM

### Bio

I am an analytics professional with an investments, finance, & market research background.  I am also a U.S. Marine Corps Veteran.  My family and I call Franklin, Tennessee home (just south of Nashville).  I enjoy scrutinizing soccer highlights, reading leadership literature, and leveling-up on data visualization techniques.  I dabble in military history, geography, and theology and also like to hike when I can find the time.  I currently work full-time for Ramsey Solutions as a data analyst in the digital marketing and real estate business analytics space.
