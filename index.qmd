## Business intelligence for the busy leader. 

Business is dynamic.  Even when it's stable, it can be hard to pin down.  

Having trouble building a good picture of what's going on?  Do you even have the time to do it?  

Do you have the bandwidth you need to remain a dependable leader?  

Are you maintaining the right level of influence when you communicate with clients or key stakeholders?

Good presentation of your data story can make or break your leadership credibility.  Sending more emails packed with text won't have the impact you're looking for.  We can help you chart the right path forward by providing simple visualizations that fit your narrative.  

## Providing bandwidth so you can focus on relationships.

It takes time and effort to develop charts that resonate, appeal, and correspond to reality.  Don't spin out. We can multiply your time and help you communicate better with data visualization.   

We can develop business intelligence dashboards and reporting that help you monitor your business environment or integrate alongside a team already dedicated to this purpose. 

1.  Tell us what you're looking for.
2.  Onboard us with your team or securely collaborate through Google Drive, Microsoft Teams, or Github.
3.  Work with us part-time, asynchronously.

We help business leaders, expanding teams, entrepreneurs, small business owners, marketers, copywriters, graphic designers, investment advisors, non-profit executives, public administrators, insurance professionals, researchers, influencers, etc.
