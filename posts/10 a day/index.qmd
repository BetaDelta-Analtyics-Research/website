Could you save $10 a day?

#### What habit could you change to save \$10 a day?

<br>

###### The power of compounding

The power of compounding is immense! If you would save \$10 a day and invest it at the end of each month for 40 years, and if that investment would grow at 7% annually, this is what how much wealth you would build.

###### financial coaching

Working with a financial coach can help you change your spending habits so that you can turn this into a reality. It's not impossible!
