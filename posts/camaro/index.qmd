Don't finance your new Camaro.

#### Need to buy a car?

<br>

###### Don't finance it.

These two charts show the difference between financing and paying cash for a new car. In this case, we're visualizing specifics related to purchasing a new 2022 Chevy Camaro, but the concept is the same. It's much cheaper to pay cash. If you finance, you lock up a lot of cash flow for a long time and pay a lot more for a depreciating asset you'll have to replace anyway. Always pay cash!

This chart is better visualized on [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/views/ChevyCamaro/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) in full-screen mode on a desktop computer.
